# Data Exploration of the Daily Shelter & Overnight Service Occupancy & Capacity dataset

## About
This project aims to provide a full-stack application to better understand the numbers and trends of occupancy and capacity counts of people and groups staying in shelters or benefitting from overnight services. The dataset is published daily by Open Data Toronto, with records going back to 2021. This program uses a Next.js frontend, a Python FastAPI backend, and CSV files for data persistence. While the city reports this data and publishes it on their website, their visualization is limited to a simple comprehensive spreadsheet. This project aims to provide various avenues for analysis, such as with charts, maps, and tables.

## Limitations
- The map has functionality to show Toronto by neighbourhood, but the data lacks any feature to link each record to the neighbourhood
- Data is available back to 2021, but currently only data until the beginning of 2025 is utilized
- Various limitations about the data itself are presented on the City's daily report
